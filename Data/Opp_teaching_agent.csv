Overall,I am glad you want to learn the object oriented concepts. They are a key conecpt in programming. Mastering this will move you from to an advanced programmer. Tell me what topic you want to learn about classes and objects,0,Start,1
What is a class?,A class is a templete defination of methods and variables of a particular object,1,Deination of a class,1.1
What is an object?,An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program,1.1,Object defination,1.2
What are the key components of a class,"Attributes: Variables that store data about an object.
Methods: Functions that define the behaviour of the objects
Constructor: A special method that initializes the objects. It has the same name with the class but does not have a return type

Destructor: A special function called when the objects are destroyed.
Access specifiers: Attributes of class members that conrol their access. There are three acess speciefiers in C++ which include
Private: this class members are only accessible in within the class they were defined.
Public: Public class members are accessible outside the class defination
Private: Private class members are accessible within their classes and derived classes",1.2,Components of a class,1.3
How do I define a class in C++?,"To create a class we use the class keyword and you specify the class atribetes and methods. For example to create a car class we will do as follows;
class Car{ //Class name
private:// Access specifier
string make; //attribute
string color;
int year_manufactur;
public:
// Constructor
    Car(string b, string m, int y) {
        brand = b;
        model = m;
        year = y;
    }
}",1.3,Class implementation,1.4
